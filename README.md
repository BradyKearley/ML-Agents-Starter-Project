# ML-Agents Reward-Seeking Agent

This project uses Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit to train an agent that seeks out and moves towards a randomly spawning reward.

## Features
- Agent is trained using reinforcement learning.
- Reward object spawns at random locations within the environment.
- Agent learns to navigate towards the reward efficiently over time.

## Requirements
- Unity ML-Agents Toolkit (`ml-agents`)
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow (for training the model)

## Training
The agent receives positive reinforcement for reaching the reward and learns to navigate efficiently. 

## Usage
Once training is complete, the trained model can be used for inference by attaching it to the agent in Unity.
